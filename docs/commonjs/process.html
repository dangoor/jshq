  <h1>CommonJS Process</h1>
  
  <p>The CommonJS group has, to date, operated in an informal manner. Our goal is to make meaningful progress toward these goals:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Design reasonable APIs for common application needs</li>
    <li>Document those designs</li>
    <li>Implement those designs in different interpreters and environments</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>The process followed through the development of CommonJS 0.5 has been:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Discussion of an API area is started on the mailing list</li>
    <li>A page is created <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ServerJS">on the wiki</a> to collect proposals and prior art</li>
    <li>Further discussion and iteration on the proposals</li>
    <li>A rough consensus is reached</li>
    <li>The proposal graduates from the wiki to this website</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>So far, achieving rough consensus among the group has been a successful route to meeting these goals. Everyone involved has interoperability on their mind and interop necessarily involves compromise and minimal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_Law_of_Triviality" target="_blank">bikeshedding</a>.</p>
  
  <p>As applications built upon the CommonJS APIs start appearing, we will likely need more process to handle changes to the API.</p>
