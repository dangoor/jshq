<p>As an initial step to allowing code re-use between JavaScript interpreters and libraries, we have defined a common module format:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="modules.html">Modules 1.0</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This format has gained broad acceptance in the community and had several implementations which were demonstrated at JSConf 2009 in Washington DC.</p>
